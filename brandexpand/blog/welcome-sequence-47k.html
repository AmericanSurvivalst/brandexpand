They're boring. They're generic. And they don't make money. "Thanks for signing up! Here's 10% off." That's not a strategy. That's a wasted opportunity.</p><p>We rebuilt a client's welcome sequence last quarter and it generated $47,000 in 30 days. Same list size. Same products. Just better emails.</p><p>Here's the exact 5-email framework we used.</p><h2>Why Welcome Sequences Matter</h2><p>The moment someone joins your list is when they're most engaged. They just raised their hand and said "I'm interested." Your job is to turn that interest into action before it fades.</p><p>Welcome emails have the highest open rates of any email type. We're talking 50-60% opens compared to 20-25% for regular campaigns. That attention is valuable. Don't waste it on a generic discount code.</p><h2>The 5-Email Framework</h2><h3>Email 1: The Instant Delivery (Immediately)</h3><p>This email has one job: deliver whatever you promised. If they signed up for a discount, give them the discount. If it was a guide, give them the guide. Don't make them wait.</p><div class="email-box"><h4>Subject: Your [thing] is inside</h4><p>Keep it short. Deliver the goods. Add one line about what's coming next. That's it.</p></div><p>Open rate target: 60%+</p><h3>Email 2: The Story (Day 1)</h3><p>Now you have their attention. Use it to build connection. Tell the founder's story. Why does this brand exist? What problem are you obsessed with solving?</p><div class="email-box"><h4>Subject: Why I started [Brand Name]</h4><p>Make it personal. Make it real. People buy from people they relate to. This isn't a sales email. It's a relationship builder.</p></div><p>Open rate target: 45%+</p><h3>Email 3: The Social Proof (Day 3)</h3><p>Show them that other people like them have bought and loved your product. Customer reviews. Before/after photos. Testimonials. User-generated content.</p><div class="email-box"><h4>Subject: See what [Customer Name] said...</h4><p>Feature 2-3 of your best reviews. Include photos if you have them. End with a soft CTA to shop.</p></div><p>Open rate target: 40%+</p><h3>Email 4: The Objection Killer (Day 5)</h3><p>By now, some people are interested but haven't bought. Why? Usually it's one of a few common objections: price, timing, uncertainty about the product.</p><div class="email-box"><h4>Subject: Still thinking about it?</h4><p>Address the top 2-3 objections head-on. Offer your guarantee. Explain your return policy. Remove the risk.</p></div><p>Open rate target: 35%+</p><h3>Email 5: The Urgency Push (Day 7)</h3><p>If they haven't bought yet, give them a reason to act now. This is where your discount code comes in (if you're using one). Or it could be a limited-time bundle, free shipping, or bonus gift.</p><div class="email-box"><h4>Subject: Last chance: [Offer] expires tonight</h4><p>Be direct. The offer is ending. Here's what you'll miss. Here's the link. That's it.</p></div><p>Open rate target: 40%+ (urgency boosts opens)</p><h2>The Results We Saw</h2><p>After implementing this sequence for a home goods client:</p><ul><li>Welcome flow revenue went from $8K to $47K per month</li><li>List-to-customer conversion rate jumped from 3% to 11%</li><li>Average order value from welcome flow increased 22%</li><li>Overall email revenue share went from 18% to 34% of total</li></ul><p>Same products. Same traffic. Just better emails.</p><h2>Keys to Making This Work</h2><p>A few things that made the difference:</p><ol><li>Write like a human, not a brand. First person. Contractions. Real talk.</li><li>Keep emails under 200 words. Nobody reads walls of text.</li><li>One CTA per email. Don't confuse people with options.</li><li>Test your subject lines. A 10% lift in opens compounds across the whole sequence.</li><li>Segment by engagement. If they opened email 3 but didn't buy, email 4 should acknowledge that.</li></ol><h2>Start Today</h2><p>If your welcome sequence is just a single "thanks for signing up" email, you're leaving money on the table. A lot of it.</p><p>Build this 5-email sequence. Test it for 30 days. Watch what happens.</p></article><section class="cta-section"><h2>Want Us to Build Your Email Flows?</h2><p>Get a free audit of your current email setup and see where you're leaving money on the table.</p><a href="https://brandexpand.agencyhandy.com/public-forms/6933030eeeb840ae051edc6a" class="cta-btn">Get Your Free Review</a></section><footer><div class="footer-grid"><div class="footer-col"><h4>&nbsp;</h4><a href="/" class="logo">BRAND EXPAND</a><p>We help brands grow online.</p><a href="https://client.brandexpand.digital/sign-in" style="margin-top: 1rem;">Client Login</a></div><div class="footer-col"><h4>Services</h4><a href="/dtc-brands.html">DTC Brands</a><a href="/service-businesses.html">Service Businesses</a><a href="/amazon-sellers.html">Amazon Sellers</a><a href="/creator-brands.html">Creator Brands</a></div><div class="footer-col"><h4>Company</h4><a href="/about.html">About</a><a href="/case-studies.html">Case Studies</a><a href="/blog.html">Blog</a><a href="https://brandexpand.agencyhandy.com/public-forms/693311aaeeb840ae051f1775">Contact</a></div></div><div class="footer-bottom"><p>© 2025 Brand Expand.
