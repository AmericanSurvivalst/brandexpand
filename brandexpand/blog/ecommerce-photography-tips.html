Bad product photography kills conversions. But good doesn't have to mean expensive. You can take photos that convert with a smartphone and $100 in basic equipment.</p><p>Here's what actually matters and what you can skip.</p><h2>Lighting is Everything</h2><p>This is the one thing that separates amateur photos from professional ones. And it's cheaper to fix than you think.</p><p>Natural light works great. Set up near a large window. Shoot during the day. Use a white foam board as a reflector to fill in shadows. Total cost: maybe $5.</p><p>If you need consistent lighting regardless of weather or time, get a basic softbox kit. Two lights with softboxes will run you $50-100 and last for years.</p><h2>The Background</h2><p>For product-only shots, you want clean and simple. White is the standard because it's versatile and makes editing easier.</p><p>A roll of white seamless paper costs $20 and gives you a professional backdrop. Curve it from the wall to the table so there's no visible horizon line. Clean and infinite.</p><p>For lifestyle shots, think about context. Where would someone use this product? That's your background.</p><h2>Camera Settings (Phone or DSLR)</h2><p>If you're using a phone, use the back camera, not the selfie camera. Turn on portrait mode for products with some depth. Make sure the lens is clean.</p><p>For DSLR or mirrorless:</p><ul><li>Aperture: f/8-f/11 for product shots (sharp throughout)</li><li>ISO: As low as possible (100-400)</li><li>Use a tripod to avoid blur</li><li>White balance: Match your lighting or shoot RAW</li></ul><h2>What to Shoot</h2><p>Every product needs multiple angles. At minimum:</p><ul><li>Front view (the hero shot)</li><li>Back view</li><li>Side views</li><li>Detail shots of important features</li><li>Scale shot (product next to something for size reference)</li><li>Lifestyle shot (product in use)</li></ul><p>More photos generally means higher conversion. People want to see what they're buying from every angle.</p><h2>Editing: Keep It Simple</h2><p>You don't need Photoshop. Free tools like Canva or phone apps can handle basic editing. Focus on:</p><ul><li>Cropping consistently (square works for most platforms)</li><li>Adjusting brightness and contrast</li><li>Making the white background actually white</li><li>Removing dust spots or blemishes</li></ul><p>Don't over-edit. The product should look like what customers will receive.</p><h2>Consistency Matters More Than Perfection</h2><p>Your product photos should look like they belong together. Same lighting. Same background. Same style. A cohesive catalog looks professional even if individual shots aren't perfect.</p><p>Create a simple style guide for yourself. Write down your setup, settings, and editing steps. Follow it for every product.</p><h2>The Budget Setup</h2><p>Here's what we'd buy if starting from scratch:</p><ul><li>White seamless paper roll: $20</li><li>Foam board reflectors (2x): $10</li><li>Basic tripod: $25</li><li>Softbox light kit (optional): $50-100</li></ul><p>Total: Under $100 (or under $200 with lights). That's it. Your phone camera does the rest.</p></article><section class="cta-section"><h2>Ready to Grow Your Business?</h2><p>Let us help you get real results with a strategy built for your goals.</p><a href="https://brandexpand.agencyhandy.com/public-forms/6933030eeeb840ae051edc6a" class="cta-btn">Get Your Free Review</a></section><footer><div class="footer-grid"><div class="footer-col"><h4>&nbsp;</h4><a href="/" class="logo">BRAND EXPAND</a><p>We help brands grow online.</p><a href="https://client.brandexpand.digital/sign-in" style="margin-top: 1rem;">Client Login</a></div><div class="footer-col"><h4>Services</h4><a href="/dtc-brands.html">DTC Brands</a><a href="/service-businesses.html">Service Businesses</a><a href="/amazon-sellers.html">Amazon Sellers</a><a href="/creator-brands.html">Creator Brands</a></div><div class="footer-col"><h4>Company</h4><a href="/about.html">About</a><a href="/case-studies.html">Case Studies</a><a href="/blog.html">Blog</a><a href="https://brandexpand.agencyhandy.com/public-forms/693311aaeeb840ae051f1775">Contact</a></div></div><div class="footer-bottom"><p>© 2025 Brand Expand.
