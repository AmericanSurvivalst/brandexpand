Someone pays for it. The question is how you structure things so that "someone" isn't eating into your margins.</p><p>We tested a free shipping threshold strategy with a client and increased their average order value by 34% in 30 days. Here's exactly what we did.</p><h2>The Setup</h2><p>The client was a home goods brand with an average order value of $47. Shipping cost them about $8 per order on average. They were offering free shipping on everything, which meant they were eating $8 on every order.</p><p>On a $47 order with 40% margins, that $8 shipping cost was cutting their profit nearly in half.</p><h2>The Strategy</h2><p>We set a free shipping threshold at $65. That's roughly 40% above their current AOV. High enough to make a difference, low enough to feel achievable.</p><p>For orders under $65, we charged $6.99 flat rate shipping. Simple and predictable.</p><h2>The Implementation</h2><p>We added a progress bar to the cart showing how close they were to free shipping. "You're $18 away from free shipping!" That visual nudge is powerful.</p><p>We also added product recommendations in the cart focused on items in the $15-25 range. Easy add-ons that pushed people over the threshold.</p><h2>The Results</h2><p>Within 30 days:</p><ul><li>AOV increased from $47 to $63 (34% lift)</li><li>72% of orders qualified for free shipping</li><li>Overall revenue increased 22%</li><li>Profit per order actually increased despite "free" shipping</li></ul><p>The math worked because people were adding $15-20 more to their carts to avoid $7 shipping. We gave away $8 in shipping but gained $15+ in margin.</p><h2>Finding Your Threshold</h2><p>The right threshold depends on your numbers. Here's how to find it:</p><ol><li>Look at your current AOV</li><li>Set threshold 30-50% higher</li><li>Make sure the margin on the additional purchase covers shipping</li><li>Test and adjust based on data</li></ol><p>If your AOV is $30, try $45. If it's $80, try $100-120. The sweet spot is high enough to increase value but low enough that people actually reach it.</p><h2>Common Mistakes</h2><p>Setting the threshold too high kills it. If your AOV is $40 and you set free shipping at $150, nobody will bother. They'll just pay for shipping or leave.</p><p>Not promoting it enough is another mistake. The threshold only works if people know about it. Put it in your header. Show it in the cart. Mention it in emails.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Free shipping is a tool, not a rule. Use it strategically to increase order values and protect your margins. The progress bar alone can be worth thousands in extra revenue per month.</p></article><section class="cta-section"><h2>Ready to Grow Your Business?</h2><p>Let us help you get real results with a strategy built for your goals.</p><a href="https://brandexpand.agencyhandy.com/public-forms/6933030eeeb840ae051edc6a" class="cta-btn">Get Your Free Review</a></section><footer><div class="footer-grid"><div class="footer-col"><h4>&nbsp;</h4><a href="/" class="logo">BRAND EXPAND</a><p>We help brands grow online.</p><a href="https://client.brandexpand.digital/sign-in" style="margin-top: 1rem;">Client Login</a></div><div class="footer-col"><h4>Services</h4><a href="/dtc-brands.html">DTC Brands</a><a href="/service-businesses.html">Service Businesses</a><a href="/amazon-sellers.html">Amazon Sellers</a><a href="/creator-brands.html">Creator Brands</a></div><div class="footer-col"><h4>Company</h4><a href="/about.html">About</a><a href="/case-studies.html">Case Studies</a><a href="/blog.html">Blog</a><a href="https://brandexpand.agencyhandy.com/public-forms/693311aaeeb840ae051f1775">Contact</a></div></div><div class="footer-bottom"><p>© 2025 Brand Expand.
