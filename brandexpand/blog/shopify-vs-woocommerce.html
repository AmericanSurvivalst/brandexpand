And honestly, the answer depends entirely on your situation. Both platforms can work. Both can make you money. But one is probably better for you specifically.</p><p>After building stores on both platforms for years, here's the real breakdown.</p><h2>The Quick Answer</h2><p>Choose Shopify if you want something that just works out of the box and you're willing to pay for convenience. Choose WooCommerce if you want full control and you have the technical skills (or budget to hire them).</p><h2>Shopify: The Pros</h2><p>Shopify is hosted, which means they handle all the technical stuff. Updates, security, server maintenance. You don't think about any of it. You just sell.</p><ul><li>Set up a store in a weekend with zero coding</li><li>Built-in payment processing with Shopify Payments</li><li>Thousands of apps for any feature you need</li><li>24/7 support when things break</li><li>Reliable uptime (your store won't crash on Black Friday)</li></ul><h2>Shopify: The Cons</h2><p>You're paying for that convenience. Monthly fees add up. Transaction fees if you don't use Shopify Payments. App fees for features that should be free.</p><ul><li>$39/month minimum for a real store (Basic plan)</li><li>2% transaction fee if you use external payment</li><li>Limited customization without coding</li><li>You don't own your store. Shopify can shut you down</li></ul><h2>WooCommerce: The Pros</h2><p>WooCommerce is free and open source. It runs on WordPress, which powers 40% of the internet. You own everything.</p><ul><li>No monthly platform fees</li><li>Complete control over every aspect of your store</li><li>Thousands of themes and plugins</li><li>You own your data and can move it anywhere</li><li>Better for SEO (WordPress is built for content)</li></ul><h2>WooCommerce: The Cons</h2><p>Free doesn't mean cheap. You need hosting. You need security. You need someone to fix things when they break. And they will break.</p><ul><li>Hosting costs $20-100+/month depending on traffic</li><li>You're responsible for updates and security</li><li>Plugin conflicts are a constant headache</li><li>Performance requires optimization work</li><li>No built-in support. You're on your own</li></ul><h2>The Real Cost Comparison</h2><h3>Shopify (First Year)</h3><p>Basic plan: $468. Theme: $0-350. Essential apps: $50-200/month. Total: roughly $1,500-3,000 for year one.</p><h3>WooCommerce (First Year)</h3><p>Hosting: $240-600. Theme: $0-60. Essential plugins: $200-500 one-time. Developer help: $500-2,000. Total: roughly $1,000-3,000 for year one.</p><p>The costs are similar. The difference is where you spend that money and how much of your time goes into it.</p><h2>Our Recommendation</h2><p>For most people starting out, go with Shopify. The simplicity is worth the cost. You'll launch faster, break fewer things, and focus on what matters: selling.</p><p>Consider WooCommerce if you already know WordPress, you want maximum control, or you're building something highly custom that Shopify can't handle.</p><p>Don't overthink this. Pick one and start selling. You can always migrate later.</p></article><section class="cta-section"><h2>Need Help Choosing?</h2><p>We'll review your business and recommend the right platform for your specific situation.</p><a href="https://brandexpand.agencyhandy.com/public-forms/6933030eeeb840ae051edc6a" class="cta-btn">Get Your Free Review</a></section><footer><div class="footer-grid"><div class="footer-col"><h4>&nbsp;</h4><a href="/" class="logo">BRAND EXPAND</a><p>We help brands grow online.</p><a href="https://client.brandexpand.digital/sign-in" style="margin-top: 1rem;">Client Login</a></div><div class="footer-col"><h4>Services</h4><a href="/dtc-brands.html">DTC Brands</a><a href="/service-businesses.html">Service Businesses</a><a href="/amazon-sellers.html">Amazon Sellers</a><a href="/creator-brands.html">Creator Brands</a></div><div class="footer-col"><h4>Company</h4><a href="/about.html">About</a><a href="/case-studies.html">Case Studies</a><a href="/blog.html">Blog</a><a href="https://brandexpand.agencyhandy.com/public-forms/693311aaeeb840ae051f1775">Contact</a></div></div><div class="footer-bottom"><p>© 2025 Brand Expand.
