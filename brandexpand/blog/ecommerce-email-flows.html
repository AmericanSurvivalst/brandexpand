If it's not, you're missing automated flows. These are emails that trigger based on customer behavior, running 24/7 without you lifting a finger.</p><p>Here are the five flows every e-commerce store needs, in order of priority.</p><h2>1. Abandoned Cart Flow</h2><p>This is the highest-ROI email flow you can build. Someone added to cart and left. They were interested. Remind them.</p><p>The sequence:</p><ul><li>Email 1 (1 hour): Simple reminder. Show the product. Link back to cart.</li><li>Email 2 (24 hours): Add social proof. Reviews. Testimonials. Why people love it.</li><li>Email 3 (48-72 hours): Create urgency or offer incentive. "Your cart expires soon" or "Here's 10% off to complete your order."</li></ul><p>Expected recovery rate: 5-15% of abandoned carts.</p><h2>2. Welcome Flow</h2><p>First impressions matter. When someone joins your list, don't just send a discount code. Build the relationship.</p><p>The sequence:</p><ul><li>Email 1 (immediate): Deliver promised incentive. Welcome them.</li><li>Email 2 (day 1): Tell your brand story. Why you exist.</li><li>Email 3 (day 3): Social proof. Customer stories and reviews.</li><li>Email 4 (day 5): Address objections. FAQ. Guarantees.</li><li>Email 5 (day 7): Stronger offer if they haven't purchased.</li></ul><p>This flow can drive 10-20% of your email revenue.</p><h2>3. Post-Purchase Flow</h2><p>The sale isn't the end. It's the beginning of a relationship. Use post-purchase emails to reduce buyer's remorse, encourage reviews, and drive repeat purchases.</p><p>The sequence:</p><ul><li>Email 1 (immediate): Order confirmation with personality.</li><li>Email 2 (shipping): Tracking info with product tips.</li><li>Email 3 (delivery + 3 days): How's it going? Request a review.</li><li>Email 4 (2 weeks): Cross-sell complementary products.</li><li>Email 5 (30 days): Replenishment reminder (if applicable).</li></ul><h2>4. Browse Abandonment Flow</h2><p>Someone looked at a product but didn't add to cart. They're less hot than cart abandoners but still worth following up with.</p><p>The sequence:</p><ul><li>Email 1 (2-4 hours): "Still thinking about [product]?"</li><li>Email 2 (24 hours): Show similar products or bestsellers.</li></ul><p>Keep this one short. Two emails max. Don't be creepy.</p><h2>5. Win-Back Flow</h2><p>Customers who haven't purchased in 60-90 days are slipping away. Win them back before they're gone.</p><p>The sequence:</p><ul><li>Email 1 (60 days): "We miss you" with new arrivals or bestsellers.</li><li>Email 2 (75 days): Special offer for returning customers.</li><li>Email 3 (90 days): Last chance. Strong offer. "Should we remove you from our list?"</li></ul><p>Some people are gone forever. That's okay. Focus on the ones you can bring back.</p><h2>Implementation Tips</h2><p>Start with abandoned cart. It's the quickest win. Then welcome. Then post-purchase. Build one flow at a time and optimize before moving to the next.</p><p>Use your email platform's built-in templates to start. Perfect is the enemy of done. A basic flow running today beats a perfect flow you never launch.</p><p>These five flows can account for 30-50% of your email revenue. Set them up once. Optimize over time. Watch the money come in.</p></article><section class="cta-section"><h2>Ready to Grow Your Business?</h2><p>Let us help you get real results with a strategy built for your goals.</p><a href="https://brandexpand.agencyhandy.com/public-forms/6933030eeeb840ae051edc6a" class="cta-btn">Get Your Free Review</a></section><footer><div class="footer-grid"><div class="footer-col"><h4>&nbsp;</h4><a href="/" class="logo">BRAND EXPAND</a><p>We help brands grow online.</p><a href="https://client.brandexpand.digital/sign-in" style="margin-top: 1rem;">Client Login</a></div><div class="footer-col"><h4>Services</h4><a href="/dtc-brands.html">DTC Brands</a><a href="/service-businesses.html">Service Businesses</a><a href="/amazon-sellers.html">Amazon Sellers</a><a href="/creator-brands.html">Creator Brands</a></div><div class="footer-col"><h4>Company</h4><a href="/about.html">About</a><a href="/case-studies.html">Case Studies</a><a href="/blog.html">Blog</a><a href="https://brandexpand.agencyhandy.com/public-forms/693311aaeeb840ae051f1775">Contact</a></div></div><div class="footer-bottom"><p>© 2025 Brand Expand.
