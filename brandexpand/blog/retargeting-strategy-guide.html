You're showing ads to people who already know you. They've visited your site. They've seen your products. They just need a nudge.</p><p>Here's how to build retargeting campaigns that convert without annoying your audience.</p><h2>Segment Your Audiences</h2><p>Not all website visitors are equal. Someone who viewed a product is hotter than someone who bounced from the homepage. Treat them differently.</p><p>Basic segments:</p><ul><li>All website visitors (broad, low intent)</li><li>Product viewers (medium intent)</li><li>Add to cart (high intent)</li><li>Checkout initiated (very high intent)</li><li>Past purchasers (retention, not acquisition)</li></ul><h2>Match Message to Intent</h2><p>Your ad should match where they are in the journey.</p><p>Homepage bouncers: Brand awareness. Social proof. Why you exist.</p><p>Product viewers: Specific product benefits. Reviews. Comparisons.</p><p>Cart abandoners: Reminder with urgency. Maybe a discount.</p><p>Checkout abandoners: Remove friction. Address objections. Offer help.</p><h2>Frequency Capping</h2><p>This is where most people screw up. Showing someone the same ad 47 times doesn't make them buy. It makes them hate you.</p><p>Set frequency caps:</p><ul><li>Meta: 2-3 impressions per day per person</li><li>Google Display: 3-5 impressions per day</li><li>YouTube: 2-3 per week</li></ul><p>If someone hasn't converted after seeing your ad 10-15 times, they're probably not going to. Let them go.</p><h2>Time Windows</h2><p>Shorter windows mean hotter audiences but smaller reach. Longer windows mean bigger audiences but colder intent.</p><p>Recommended windows:</p><ul><li>Cart abandoners: 1-7 days (hot, act fast)</li><li>Product viewers: 7-14 days</li><li>All visitors: 14-30 days</li><li>Past purchasers: 30-90 days (for replenishment)</li></ul><h2>Creative Rotation</h2><p>People tune out the same ad. Rotate creatives every 1-2 weeks. Show different angles, different social proof, different offers.</p><p>Sequence your messaging:</p><ol><li>Week 1: Product benefits and features</li><li>Week 2: Social proof and reviews</li><li>Week 3: Urgency or limited offer</li><li>Week 4: New creative angle</li></ol><h2>Exclusions Are Critical</h2><p>Exclude recent purchasers from acquisition retargeting. Nobody wants to see an ad for something they just bought. It's wasteful and annoying.</p><p>Also exclude people who have seen too many ads (high frequency) and people who have complained or hidden your ads.</p><h2>Budget Allocation</h2><p>Retargeting should be 15-30% of your total ad budget. It's efficient, but the audiences are small. You can't scale retargeting infinitely.</p><p>Prioritize by intent:</p><ol><li>Cart/checkout abandoners (highest priority)</li><li>Product viewers</li><li>All visitors</li></ol><h2>Measure Incrementality</h2><p>Some retargeting conversions would have happened anyway. Run holdout tests occasionally. Exclude 10% of your retargeting audience and compare conversion rates.</p><p>If the non-retargeted group converts at almost the same rate, your retargeting might not be adding as much value as you think.</p></article><section class="cta-section"><h2>Ready to Grow Your Business?</h2><p>Let us help you get real results with a strategy built for your goals.</p><a href="https://brandexpand.agencyhandy.com/public-forms/6933030eeeb840ae051edc6a" class="cta-btn">Get Your Free Review</a></section><footer><div class="footer-grid"><div class="footer-col"><h4>&nbsp;</h4><a href="/" class="logo">BRAND EXPAND</a><p>We help brands grow online.</p><a href="https://client.brandexpand.digital/sign-in" style="margin-top: 1rem;">Client Login</a></div><div class="footer-col"><h4>Services</h4><a href="/dtc-brands.html">DTC Brands</a><a href="/service-businesses.html">Service Businesses</a><a href="/amazon-sellers.html">Amazon Sellers</a><a href="/creator-brands.html">Creator Brands</a></div><div class="footer-col"><h4>Company</h4><a href="/about.html">About</a><a href="/case-studies.html">Case Studies</a><a href="/blog.html">Blog</a><a href="https://brandexpand.agencyhandy.com/public-forms/693311aaeeb840ae051f1775">Contact</a></div></div><div class="footer-bottom"><p>© 2025 Brand Expand.
