Every plumber in Norfolk County is fighting for the same emergency calls, water heater replacements, and bathroom remodels. The question isn't whether you're good at what you do—it's whether customers can find you when they need you.</p>

<h2>Why Most Wrentham Plumbers Struggle to Get Found Online</h2>
<p>When someone's basement is flooding at 10pm, they're grabbing their phone and searching "emergency plumber Wrentham" or "plumber near me." If you're not showing up, you're invisible—and losing jobs to competitors who've figured out the digital game.</p>

<h2>Google Business Profile: Your Most Important Marketing Asset</h2>
<p>Your Google Business Profile is the single most important marketing tool for a plumbing business. The Local Pack (the map with three businesses) gets the most clicks—and your GBP determines whether you show up there.</p>

<h3>Optimizing Your GBP</h3>
<p><strong>Primary category:</strong> "Plumber"—not "Plumbing Service." Your primary category carries the most weight.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary categories:</strong> Add "Water Heater Installation Service," "Drain Cleaning Service," "Emergency Plumber."</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Mention Wrentham, surrounding towns, and key services.</p>
<p><strong>Photos:</strong> Post weekly. Businesses with 100+ photos get 520% more calls than those with fewer than 10.</p>

<div class="callout"><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Make sure your NAP (name, address, phone) is identical everywhere online—your website, Facebook, Yelp, Angi. Inconsistencies hurt your rankings.</p></div>

<h2>Reviews: The Make-or-Break Factor</h2>
<p>A plumber with 150 reviews and a 4.8 rating will almost always beat a plumber with 12 reviews and a 5.0 rating. Volume matters. Recency matters.</p>
<p><strong>Ask at the right moment:</strong> Right after you've solved their problem. "If you have a minute, a Google review really helps our small business."</p>
<p><strong>Make it easy:</strong> Send a direct link via text. Target 5+ reviews per month.</p>

<h2>Your Website: Converting Visitors Into Calls</h2>
<p>Your website has one job: get people to call you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phone number in the header</strong>—big, clickable, visible on every page</li>
<li><strong>Service pages for each service</strong>—"Water Heater Installation Wrentham," "Drain Cleaning Wrentham," etc.</li>
<li><strong>Location pages for each town you serve</strong></li>
<li><strong>Trust signals everywhere</strong>—license numbers, insurance, years in business, team photos</li>
</ul>

<h2>Paid Advertising: When to Invest</h2>
<p><strong>Google Local Service Ads</strong> are particularly effective for plumbers. You only pay for actual leads, get the "Google Guaranteed" badge, and show up at the very top of results. Expect to pay $25-50+ per lead in the Wrentham/Norfolk County area.</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Marketing a plumbing business in Wrentham comes down to: being findable, being credible, and being easy to contact. Nail your Google Business Profile, build a steady stream of reviews, create a website that converts—and you'll be ahead of 90% of your competitors.</p></article><section class="cta-section"><h2>Ready to Dominate Wrentham?</h2><p>We help plumbing contractors build marketing systems that generate consistent leads.</p><a href="https://brandexpand.agencyhandy.com/public-forms/6933030eeeb840ae051edc6a" class="cta-btn">Get Your Free Marketing Review</a></section><footer><div class="footer-grid"><div class="footer-col"><a href="/" class="logo" style="color:var(--white)">BRAND EXPAND</a><p style="color:rgba(255,255,255,0.6);font-size:0.875rem;margin-top:0.5rem">Digital marketing for service businesses.</p></div><div class="footer-col"><h4>Services</h4><a href="/service-businesses">Service Businesses</a><a href="/dtc-brands">DTC Brands</a></div><div class="footer-col"><h4>Company</h4><a href="/about">About</a><a href="/blog">Blog</a></div></div><div class="footer-bottom"><p>© 2025 Brand Expand.
