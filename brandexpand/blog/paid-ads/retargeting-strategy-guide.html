    <p>Retargeting is the closest thing to a sure bet in paid advertising. You're showing ads to people who already know you. They've visited your site. They've seen your products. They just need a nudge.</p>
    
    <p>Here's how to build retargeting campaigns that convert without annoying your audience.</p>

    <h2>Segment Your Audiences</h2>
    
    <p>Not all website visitors are equal. Someone who viewed a product is hotter than someone who bounced from the homepage. Treat them differently.</p>
    
    <p>Basic segments:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All website visitors (broad, low intent)</li>
      <li>Product viewers (medium intent)</li>
      <li>Add to cart (high intent)</li>
      <li>Checkout initiated (very high intent)</li>
      <li>Past purchasers (retention, not acquisition)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Match Message to Intent</h2>
    
    <p>Your ad should match where they are in the journey.</p>
    
    <p>Homepage bouncers: Brand awareness. Social proof. Why you exist.</p>
    <p>Product viewers: Specific product benefits. Reviews. Comparisons.</p>
    <p>Cart abandoners: Reminder with urgency. Maybe a discount.</p>
    <p>Checkout abandoners: Remove friction. Address objections. Offer help.</p>

    <h2>Frequency Capping</h2>
    
    <p>This is where most people screw up. Showing someone the same ad 47 times doesn't make them buy. It makes them hate you.</p>
    
    <p>Set frequency caps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Meta: 2-3 impressions per day per person</li>
      <li>Google Display: 3-5 impressions per day</li>
      <li>YouTube: 2-3 per week</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If someone hasn't converted after seeing your ad 10-15 times, they're probably not going to. Let them go.</p>

    <h2>Time Windows</h2>
    
    <p>Shorter windows mean hotter audiences but smaller reach. Longer windows mean bigger audiences but colder intent.</p>
    
    <p>Recommended windows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cart abandoners: 1-7 days (hot, act fast)</li>
      <li>Product viewers: 7-14 days</li>
      <li>All visitors: 14-30 days</li>
      <li>Past purchasers: 30-90 days (for replenishment)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Creative Rotation</h2>
    
    <p>People tune out the same ad. Rotate creatives every 1-2 weeks. Show different angles, different social proof, different offers.</p>
    
    <p>Sequence your messaging:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Week 1: Product benefits and features</li>
      <li>Week 2: Social proof and reviews</li>
      <li>Week 3: Urgency or limited offer</li>
      <li>Week 4: New creative angle</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Exclusions Are Critical</h2>
    
    <p>Exclude recent purchasers from acquisition retargeting. Nobody wants to see an ad for something they just bought. It's wasteful and annoying.</p>
    
    <p>Also exclude people who have seen too many ads (high frequency) and people who have complained or hidden your ads.</p>

    <h2>Budget Allocation</h2>
    
    <p>Retargeting should be 15-30% of your total ad budget. It's efficient, but the audiences are small. You can't scale retargeting infinitely.</p>
    
    <p>Prioritize by intent:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Cart/checkout abandoners (highest priority)</li>
      <li>Product viewers</li>
      <li>All visitors</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Measure Incrementality</h2>
    
    <p>Some retargeting conversions would have happened anyway. Run holdout tests occasionally. Exclude 10% of your retargeting audience and compare conversion rates.</p>
    
    <p>If the non-retargeted group converts at almost the same rate, your retargeting might not be adding as much value as you think.</p>
