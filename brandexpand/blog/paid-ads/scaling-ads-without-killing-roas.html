    <p>Every advertiser hits this wall. You find something that works. You try to spend more. ROAS tanks. You pull back. Back to square one.</p>
    
    <p>Scaling is hard because platforms don't scale linearly. Double your budget doesn't mean double your results. But there are ways to grow spend while maintaining efficiency.</p>

    <h2>Why ROAS Drops When You Scale</h2>
    
    <p>You start by reaching the most likely buyers. As you spend more, you reach people progressively less likely to buy. That's how the auction works. The best audience costs the most.</p>
    
    <p>Also, increased spend means increased frequency. Your audience sees your ads more often. Fatigue kicks in. Performance drops.</p>

    <h2>The 20% Rule</h2>
    
    <p>Never increase budget more than 20% at a time. Bigger jumps reset the learning phase and cause volatility.</p>
    
    <p>If you're spending $100/day and want to reach $500/day:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Week 1: $100 → $120</li>
      <li>Week 2: $120 → $144</li>
      <li>Week 3: $144 → $173</li>
      <li>Week 4: $173 → $207</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>It takes longer but preserves performance. Patience pays.</p>

    <h2>Horizontal Scaling</h2>
    
    <p>Instead of pumping more money into what works, duplicate it.</p>
    
    <p>Create new ad sets targeting different audiences with the same winning creative. Test new interest groups. New lookalikes. New demographics. New placements.</p>
    
    <p>Each new ad set has its own learning budget. You scale total spend without hammering a single audience.</p>

    <h2>Creative Diversification</h2>
    
    <p>One creative can only do so much. To scale, you need multiple winning creatives running simultaneously.</p>
    
    <p>Different creatives appeal to different segments. A testimonial ad might crush with one audience while a product demo wins with another. More creatives means more doors into your funnel.</p>

    <h2>Campaign Structure for Scale</h2>
    
    <p>Structure matters more at scale. Consolidate where possible to give the algorithm more data per campaign.</p>
    
    <p>Good structure:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1-2 prospecting campaigns (broad)</li>
      <li>1 retargeting campaign (all warm audiences)</li>
      <li>1 testing campaign (new creatives)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Bad structure: 17 campaigns with $20/day each, all competing for the same audiences.</p>

    <h2>Expand Your Funnel</h2>
    
    <p>Scaling isn't just about ads. Can your site handle more traffic? Do you have enough inventory? Is your email follow-up optimized?</p>
    
    <p>Often the scaling constraint isn't the ads. It's the conversion rate. Improving your site from 2% to 2.5% conversion is like getting 25% more from every ad dollar.</p>

    <h2>Know Your Ceiling</h2>
    
    <p>Every market has a ceiling. There are only so many people who want your product at any given time. When you start seeing diminishing returns no matter what you try, you might be near it.</p>
    
    <p>At that point, scaling means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>New products</li>
      <li>New markets</li>
      <li>New channels</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Don't force scale where it doesn't exist. Recognize the ceiling and diversify.</p>

    <h2>Accept Some ROAS Drop</h2>
    
    <p>Scaling at the same ROAS is the dream. Reality is that efficiency drops somewhat as you grow. The question is whether the additional profit is worth it.</p>
    
    <p>$1,000/day at 4x ROAS = $4,000 revenue, ~$1,500 profit</p>
    <p>$2,000/day at 3x ROAS = $6,000 revenue, ~$2,000 profit</p>
    
    <p>Lower ROAS but higher profit. Sometimes that's the right trade.</p>
