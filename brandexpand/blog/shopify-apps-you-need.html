And almost every single one has the same problem: too many apps. We've seen stores with 30, 40, even 50 apps installed. Monthly app costs over $500. And most of them aren't doing anything.</p><p>Here's the truth: you only need 5 apps to run a profitable Shopify store. Everything else is either a nice-to-have or straight up bloat that's slowing down your site.</p><h2>Why Too Many Apps Kill Your Store</h2><p>Every app you install adds code to your site. That code has to load. And the more code that loads, the slower your site gets.</p><p>Google has made it clear: site speed matters. A one-second delay in page load can drop conversions by 7%. If your site takes 5 seconds to load instead of 2, you're losing sales. Period.</p><p>Beyond speed, apps conflict with each other. They break things. They require updates. They become security vulnerabilities. Keep it simple.</p><h2>The 5 Essential Apps</h2><h3>1. Email Marketing (Klaviyo)</h3><p>Email is still the highest ROI channel in e-commerce. You need an app that captures emails, segments your list, and sends automated flows. Klaviyo is the gold standard for Shopify.</p><p>At minimum, set up these flows: Welcome series, abandoned cart, post-purchase, and win-back. These four automations alone can add 20-30% to your revenue.</p><h3>2. Reviews (Judge.me or Loox)</h3><p>Social proof sells. You need a way to collect and display customer reviews. Judge.me is great if you want text reviews. Loox is better if photo reviews matter for your product.</p><p>Both have free tiers that work fine for most stores. Don't overthink this one.</p><h3>3. Upsells (ReConvert or CartHook)</h3><p>The easiest way to increase average order value is to make relevant offers at checkout and post-purchase. A good upsell app pays for itself in the first week.</p><p>Start simple: offer a complementary product at 15-20% off right after purchase. Test different offers until you find what converts.</p><h3>4. SEO (No App Needed)</h3><p>Hot take: you don't need an SEO app. Shopify's built-in SEO features are good enough for 90% of stores. Write good product descriptions, optimize your title tags, and focus on getting backlinks.</p><p>If you really want an app, Smart SEO is lightweight and handles the basics. But it's not essential.</p><h3>5. Analytics (Lucky Orange or Hotjar)</h3><p>You need to see how people actually use your site. Where do they click? Where do they get stuck? Where do they leave?</p><p>Session recordings and heatmaps will show you exactly what's broken. Fix those things and conversions go up. It's that simple.</p><h2>Apps to Avoid</h2><p>Some categories of apps are almost always a waste:</p><ul><li>Currency converters (Shopify has this built in now)</li><li>Social media feed widgets (they slow your site and nobody cares)</li><li>Exit-intent popups (usually annoying and rarely convert)</li><li>Countdown timers (fake urgency doesn't work anymore)</li><li>Chat widgets (unless you actually have someone to respond)</li></ul><h2>The Audit Process</h2><p>Here's how to clean up your app situation:</p><ol><li>List every app you have installed</li><li>For each app, ask: "Did this directly generate revenue in the last 30 days?"</li><li>If the answer is no or you're not sure, uninstall it</li><li>Test your site speed before and after (use Google PageSpeed Insights)</li><li>Monitor your conversion rate for the next 2 weeks</li></ol><p>Most stores see an immediate improvement in site speed and a gradual improvement in conversions after cleaning up their apps.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>More apps doesn't mean more sales. Usually it means more problems. Stick to the essentials, keep your site fast, and focus on what actually moves the needle: great products, clear messaging, and consistent traffic.</p></article><section class="cta-section"><h2>Need Help Optimizing Your Store?</h2><p>Get a free audit of your Shopify setup and recommendations for improvement.</p><a href="https://brandexpand.agencyhandy.com/public-forms/6933030eeeb840ae051edc6a" class="cta-btn">Get Your Free Review</a></section><footer><div class="footer-grid"><div class="footer-col"><h4>&nbsp;</h4><a href="/" class="logo">BRAND EXPAND</a><p>We help brands grow online.</p><a href="https://client.brandexpand.digital/sign-in" style="margin-top: 1rem;">Client Login</a></div><div class="footer-col"><h4>Services</h4><a href="/dtc-brands.html">DTC Brands</a><a href="/service-businesses.html">Service Businesses</a><a href="/amazon-sellers.html">Amazon Sellers</a><a href="/creator-brands.html">Creator Brands</a></div><div class="footer-col"><h4>Company</h4><a href="/about.html">About</a><a href="/case-studies.html">Case Studies</a><a href="/blog.html">Blog</a><a href="https://brandexpand.agencyhandy.com/public-forms/693311aaeeb840ae051f1775">Contact</a></div></div><div class="footer-bottom"><p>© 2025 Brand Expand.
