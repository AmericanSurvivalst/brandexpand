You're spending money. But the sales aren't coming in. Sound familiar? You're not alone. Most businesses waste thousands on Meta ads because they skip the fundamentals.</p><p>After managing over $2M in ad spend across dozens of accounts, we've seen the same mistakes over and over. Here's what's actually going wrong and how to fix it.</p><h2>The Real Problem: You're Selling Too Fast</h2><p>The biggest mistake we see? Running conversion campaigns to cold audiences with a "Buy Now" message. It doesn't work. These people don't know you. They don't trust you. And they're definitely not ready to pull out their credit card.</p><p>Think about it this way: Would you marry someone on the first date? That's what you're asking people to do when you run purchase-focused ads to cold traffic.</p><h2>The Fix: A Simple 3-Stage Funnel</h2><h3>Stage 1: Awareness (Top of Funnel)</h3><p>Your goal here is simple: get eyeballs. Run video ads that educate, entertain, or inspire. No hard sell. You're just trying to get people to stop scrolling and pay attention to you.</p><p>Optimize for video views (ThruPlay) or engagement. Cost per result should be cheap here. If you're paying more than $0.05 per ThruPlay, your creative needs work.</p><h3>Stage 2: Consideration (Middle of Funnel)</h3><p>Now you're talking to people who actually watched your video or engaged with your page. They know who you are. This is where you can introduce your product or service.</p><p>Lead magnets work great here. Free guides, quizzes, webinars. Give them something valuable in exchange for their email. Now you own that relationship.</p><h3>Stage 3: Conversion (Bottom of Funnel)</h3><p>This is where you go for the sale. But only to people who have already engaged with you. Retarget your video viewers, your website visitors, your email list.</p><p>These people are warm. They know you. They trust you. Now when you say "Buy Now," they actually might.</p><h2>The Checklist That Actually Matters</h2><p>Before you spend another dollar on ads, make sure you can check every box:</p><ul><li>Your Pixel is installed correctly and firing on all pages</li><li>You have at least 3 different creatives per ad set (video performs best)</li><li>Your landing page loads in under 3 seconds on mobile</li><li>Your offer is clear and compelling within the first 5 seconds</li><li>You're running separate campaigns for cold and warm audiences</li><li>You have a retargeting campaign set up for website visitors</li><li>Your ad copy speaks to a specific pain point, not generic benefits</li></ul><h2>Quick Wins You Can Implement Today</h2><p>If your ads are struggling, try these fixes first:</p><ol><li>Kill any ad that hasn't gotten a purchase after spending 2x your target CPA</li><li>Test a video ad if you're only running static images</li><li>Narrow your audience. Broad doesn't work until you have tons of data</li><li>Check your mobile landing page. 80%+ of your traffic is on mobile</li><li>Add social proof. Reviews, testimonials, user-generated content</li></ol><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Facebook ads work. We've seen them transform businesses. But they only work when you respect the buyer's journey. Stop trying to close on the first touch. Build the relationship first.</p><p>Start with awareness. Move to consideration. Then go for the conversion. It takes more patience, but it's the only approach that scales profitably.</p><p>Need help setting this up? That's what we do.
