    <p>Pricing isn't math. It's psychology. The difference between $29 and $30 isn't a dollar. It's a mental barrier. Understanding how people perceive prices can dramatically change your conversion rates.</p>
    
    <p>Here are the pricing psychology principles that actually work in e-commerce.</p>

    <h2>Charm Pricing Still Works</h2>
    
    <p>Ending prices in .99 or .97 isn't new. But it still works. Studies consistently show that $29.99 outsells $30.00 even though everyone knows the trick.</p>
    
    <p>Why? We read left to right. Our brain anchors on the first number. $29.99 feels like "twenty-something" while $30.00 feels like "thirty." That gap matters.</p>
    
    <p>Use charm pricing for value-focused products. Use round numbers for premium or luxury items where you want to signal quality over value.</p>

    <h2>Anchoring: The Power of Context</h2>
    
    <p>People don't evaluate prices in isolation. They compare. Use that.</p>
    
    <p>If you have three pricing tiers, the highest tier makes the middle tier look reasonable. A $200 option makes $120 feel like a deal, even if $120 was always the target price.</p>
    
    <p>Show the original price crossed out next to the sale price. That anchor makes the discount feel real. "$80 $59" hits different than just "$59."</p>

    <h2>The Decoy Effect</h2>
    
    <p>Add an option that exists mainly to make another option look better.</p>
    
    <p>Classic example: Small $3, Medium $6, Large $7. Nobody buys the medium. It exists to make the large look like an obvious choice. "Only a dollar more for way more product."</p>
    
    <p>In e-commerce, this might be a basic vs premium vs ultimate bundle where the premium is priced just slightly below the ultimate.</p>

    <h2>Price Per Use Framing</h2>
    
    <p>A $120 product sounds expensive. $1 per day for four months sounds cheap. Same math, different perception.</p>
    
    <p>Break down prices into smaller units when selling higher-priced items. "Less than your daily coffee" is a cliche because it works.</p>

    <h2>Remove the Dollar Sign</h2>
    
    <p>Studies show that removing the dollar sign can increase spending. "29" feels less like money than "$29." Restaurant menus figured this out years ago.</p>
    
    <p>Test this on your product pages. Some brands see meaningful lifts from this simple change.</p>

    <h2>Bundling Psychology</h2>
    
    <p>People hate paying separately for things that feel like they should go together. That's why bundles work.</p>
    
    <p>A $50 product + $30 product sold as a $70 bundle feels like a deal even though you're only saving $10. The bundle price becomes the anchor, not the individual prices.</p>
    
    <p>Create bundles that make sense. Complementary products. Complete solutions. Starter kits.</p>

    <h2>Free Shipping Math</h2>
    
    <p>$50 product with $8 shipping often loses to $58 product with free shipping. People irrationally hate shipping costs. Bake it into your price when possible.</p>
    
    <p>This is why free shipping thresholds work so well. People will add $15 to their cart to avoid $8 shipping. The math doesn't math, but the psychology does.</p>

    <h2>Test Everything</h2>
    
    <p>These principles are starting points, not rules. Your audience might respond differently. A/B test your pricing presentation. Track conversion rates at different price points. Let data guide your decisions.</p>
    
    <p>Small pricing changes can have massive revenue impacts. A 5% increase in conversion rate from better price presentation is pure profit.</p>
