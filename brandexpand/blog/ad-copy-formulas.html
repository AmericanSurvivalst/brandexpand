You don't need to reinvent the wheel every time you write an ad. Use proven formulas and adapt them to your product.</p><p>Here are five formulas that consistently work, with examples you can steal.</p><h2>1. Problem-Agitate-Solve (PAS)</h2><p>Identify the problem. Twist the knife. Offer the solution.</p><p>Example:</p><p>"Tired of waking up with back pain? (Problem) Every morning feels like you aged 20 years overnight. You've tried new mattresses, new pillows, nothing works. (Agitate) Our ergonomic pillow aligns your spine while you sleep. Wake up feeling 25 again. (Solve)"</p><p>This works because it meets people where they are emotionally before offering the fix.</p><h2>2. Before-After-Bridge (BAB)</h2><p>Paint the current reality. Show the desired future. Bridge with your product.</p><p>Example:</p><p>"Before: Spending 2 hours on meal prep every Sunday. Eating sad desk lunches. Ordering takeout because you're too tired to cook. (Before) After: Healthy meals ready in 15 minutes. Actually enjoying what you eat. Saving $400/month on takeout. (After) Our meal kit service delivers pre-portioned ingredients and 15-minute recipes to your door. (Bridge)"</p><h2>3. The Story Hook</h2><p>Open with a mini-story that creates curiosity. People are wired for stories.</p><p>Example:</p><p>"I almost gave up on skincare entirely. 10 years of trying products that promised miracles and delivered nothing. Then my dermatologist told me I was doing it all wrong. Turns out, 90% of skincare products are useless if you don't fix this one thing first..."</p><p>The story creates emotional connection and the open loop creates curiosity.</p><h2>4. Social Proof Lead</h2><p>Lead with what others are saying. Let customers sell for you.</p><p>Example:</p><p>"Over 47,000 customers can't be wrong. Here's why people are switching to [Brand]:"</p><p>"I was skeptical at first, but wow. This actually works." - Sarah M.</p><p>"Best purchase I made all year. Already bought two more as gifts." - Mike T.</p><p>Numbers + testimonials = instant credibility.</p><h2>5. The Direct Response Classic</h2><p>Headline benefit. Support with features. Clear CTA.</p><p>Example:</p><p>"Get clearer skin in 14 days or your money back.</p><p>Our 3-step system uses dermatologist-recommended ingredients to clear acne without drying your skin.</p><ul><li>2% salicylic acid</li><li>Niacinamide for redness</li><li>Hyaluronic acid for hydration</li></ul><p>Join 50,000+ customers with clearer skin. Shop now."</p><p>Simple. Clear. Effective.</p><h2>Adapting Formulas</h2><p>Don't use these word-for-word. Adapt to your voice and product. The formula is the skeleton. Your specific language and benefits are the flesh.</p><p>Test different formulas against each other. What works in one market might not work in another. Let data tell you which formula resonates with your audience.</p><h2>Length Matters</h2><p>For Meta, shorter usually wins. Get to the point in the first line. Use the "see more" fold strategically.</p><p>For Google, match user intent. Someone searching for a specific product wants details. Someone searching for a solution might want the story.</p></article><section class="cta-section"><h2>Ready to Grow Your Business?</h2><p>Let us help you get real results with a strategy built for your goals.</p><a href="https://brandexpand.agencyhandy.com/public-forms/6933030eeeb840ae051edc6a" class="cta-btn">Get Your Free Review</a></section><footer><div class="footer-grid"><div class="footer-col"><h4>&nbsp;</h4><a href="/" class="logo">BRAND EXPAND</a><p>We help brands grow online.</p><a href="https://client.brandexpand.digital/sign-in" style="margin-top: 1rem;">Client Login</a></div><div class="footer-col"><h4>Services</h4><a href="/dtc-brands.html">DTC Brands</a><a href="/service-businesses.html">Service Businesses</a><a href="/amazon-sellers.html">Amazon Sellers</a><a href="/creator-brands.html">Creator Brands</a></div><div class="footer-col"><h4>Company</h4><a href="/about.html">About</a><a href="/case-studies.html">Case Studies</a><a href="/blog.html">Blog</a><a href="https://brandexpand.agencyhandy.com/public-forms/693311aaeeb840ae051f1775">Contact</a></div></div><div class="footer-bottom"><p>© 2025 Brand Expand.
